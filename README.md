# Challenge-5
### Overview
Pymaceuticals Inc. is a burgeoning pharmaceutical company specializing in anti-cancer drug therapies. The company has conducted a 45-day clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of several drug regimens, particularly focusing on Capomulin, and its comparative performance against other treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

### Objective
The primary objective of this project was to analyze the clinical trial data to identify the most effective treatment regimens. The analysis involved data cleaning, generating summary statistics, and visualizing the results using tables and figures to discern patterns and correlations that would guide future research and development.

### Methodology
This project was developed by the following analyses on the clinical trial data:

Data Wrangling: Identified and removed any data anomalies, ensuring a robust dataset for accurate analysis.
Treatment Analysis: Calculated statistical metrics like mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of tumor volumes for each drug regimen.
Gender Distribution: Assessed the balance between the number of male and female mice in the study.
Efficacy Comparison: Compared the performance of drug regimens to identify the most effective treatments based on final tumor volume.
Correlation Study: Analyzed the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment.
Visualizations: Generated bar plots, pie charts, and box plots to visualize the data and findings effectively.

### Results
The analysis concluded that Capomulin and Ramicane were the most effective treatments among the regimens tested. A strong correlation was found between mouse weight and tumor volume, which may affect treatment efficacy.

### Conclusions and Recommendations
Based on the findings, it can be determined that for further investigation into the dosing of Capomulin concerning mouse weight and potential expansion of the trial to larger sample sizes to confirm the efficacy of Capomulin and Ramicane. Additional studies should also consider the implications of the strong weight-tumor volume correlation observed.
